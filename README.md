# CGPA-CALCULATOR


## Description


- I made use of the CSS table structure to fix in the input box
- This Project was inspired by the difficulty faced by so many students of the higher instition in Nigeria when trying to calculate their CGPA.
- Weeks after being into Javascript, I thought of it and it came into realization.
- Based on the scores entered by the users, a conditional statement to assign a point to each scores was written
- The CGPA is then calculated by addding the total points and then dividing it with the total no of units entered

## Challenges

-Writing the code to append new input box to the table was one of the the major challenges I faced while building the App. I got it right and succesfully created a function to allow users append as many as possible input box to the table.

## How-to-use-the-App
- Enter your scores
- An automated box at the right has been programmed to give a point to each range of scores
- Lastly, enter the number of unit of the entered score
- Repeat the process depending on the number of scores
- Click the Get CGPA button
